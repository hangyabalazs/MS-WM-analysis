acgmod is the function called to run acg analysis. 
theta_rhythmicity_panel is the main fucntion to create Fig5. 
Raster inset for example neurons are made independently (single raster isolated from regular raster plot produced
by viewcell2b.m). This calls theta_supp_panels for panels S8-9 of theta group heatmaps, averages and raster & psth for example neurons per group, 
and calls theta_piecharts_supp for S10.
